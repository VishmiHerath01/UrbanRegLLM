    "question": "What is the minimum plot coverage requirement for buildings of different heights?",
    "answer": "Plot coverage requirements depend on building height. For buildings up to 50m height, requirements are specified in the gazetted Development Plan. For buildings 50m or taller, requirements must comply with Form E in Schedule 6, if such requirement is less than specified in the Development Plan. This ensures adequate open space around tall buildings for safety, ventilation, and aesthetics."

    "answer": "Floor space of veranda, Balcony or cantilever having more than 1.2m overhanging width shall be included in the Permissible Floor Area calculation. This means that while overhangs up to 1.2m are not counted in floor area calculations, anything exceeding this limit must be included when determining if the building meets permissible floor area requirements."

    "question": "How do the rainwater harvesting requirements vary across different rainfall zones in Sri Lanka?",
    "answer": "Rainwater harvesting requirements are tailored to eight annual rainfall bands from 750mm to 6000mm. Areas with lower rainfall (750-1000mm) require more storage (1.5-10m\u00b3 per 100m\u00b2 of roof/hard area, depending on building type) than areas with higher rainfall (5000-6000mm, where only 0.5-2.5m\u00b3 per 100m\u00b2 is required). This sliding scale ensures appropriate water conservation across Sri Lanka's diverse climate zones, with residential buildings generally requiring 1.5-2.5m\u00b3 regardless of location, while commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings have requirements that decrease significantly in high-rainfall areas."

    "question": "What detailed requirements exist for construction near expressways?",
    "answer": "Developments near expressways must follow Schedule 17 requirements, which establish multiple zones with different setbacks and permitted uses: 1) Immediate buffer zones prohibit most development, 2) Secondary zones allow limited development types with strict controls, 3) Tertiary zones permit more development with specific conditions. Building heights, uses, and densities are regulated based on distance from the expressway, with greater restrictions closer to the road. These requirements protect expressway functionality, safety, and visual quality while managing development patterns along these major corridors."
