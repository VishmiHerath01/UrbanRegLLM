    "question": "How do I calculate the Permissible Floor Area for my property that is 2,500m\u00b2 in area, has a 20m road frontage, faces a 12m wide road, and is located in a zone with factor 1.50?",
    "answer": "To calculate your Permissible Floor Area, refer to Form A in Schedule 6. For a 2,500m\u00b2 plot with access from a 12m wide road in a zone with factor 1.50, the Permissible Floor Area Ratio is 5.5. Therefore, your Permissible Floor Area is 2,500m\u00b2 \u00d7 5.5 = 13,750m\u00b2. Note that parking facilities required by regulations, air-conditioning plants, and service machinery are excluded from this calculation."

    "question": "I have a corner lot at the intersection of a 9m road and a 6m road. How should I calculate the required corner splay?",
    "answer": "For a corner lot at the intersection of a 9m road and a 6m road, you must round off or splay the corner by maintaining half the width of each road from the corner point. This means you need a splay of 4.5m (half of 9m) along one road and 3m (half of 6m) along the other road from the corner point. This requirement ensures visibility at the intersection for traffic safety."

    "question": "My property is 400m\u00b2 with a 12m frontage on a 9m wide road, located in a Medium Density Zone. What is the maximum number of floors I can build?",
    "answer": "For a 400m\u00b2 property with frontage on a 9m wide road in a Medium Density Zone, refer to Form C in Schedule 6. According to the table, your Permissible Floor Area Ratio is 1.6. To determine the maximum number of floors, you must consider other factors like plot coverage (typically 65% for residential zones) and setback requirements from Form E in Schedule 6. With 65% plot coverage on a 400m\u00b2 lot, your building footprint would be 260m\u00b2. With a total permissible floor area of 640m\u00b2 (400m\u00b2 \u00d7 1.6), you could potentially build approximately 2-3 floors depending on your exact layout and setbacks."

    "question": "I'm planning to develop a land with irregular shape. The site has only 4m frontage on the road but widens to 15m width after 5m depth. What are the special provisions that apply?",
    "answer": "For your irregularly shaped land with 4m frontage widening to 15m: 1) Since your frontage exceeds the minimum requirement of 3m, development is permitted, 2) You can develop the portion of land beyond the point where the width becomes 6m wide, 3) The Relevant Authority may direct alternative means of providing open space if it's impractical to provide the standard rear space, 4) You must still comply with all other regulatory requirements regarding plot coverage, height limitations, and setbacks. Be aware that buildings on sites with road frontage less than 6m cannot exceed 10m in height unless otherwise specified in a Development Plan."

    "question": "My property has frontages on three roads: 20m on a 12m-wide main road, 15m on a 6m-wide side road, and 10m on a 4.5m-wide back road. How do I calculate the road frontage for Permissible Floor Area purposes?",
    "answer": "For a property with multiple road frontages, calculate as follows: 1) For the main road (12m wide): Use the full frontage of 20m, 2) For the side road (6m wide): Since this is 6m or more in width, calculate the proportionate frontage as 20m \u00d7 (6m \u00f7 12m) = 10m, 3) For the back road (4.5m wide): Since this is less than 6m wide, use the full width of the road itself, which is 4.5m. Your total calculated road frontage would be 20m + 10m + 4.5m = 34.5m. Use this value when determining your Permissible Floor Area from the appropriate table in Schedule 6."

For buildings between 12.0-18.0m in height: 1) Rear space requirement is 4.0m, 2) Side space requirement is 3.0m on both sides.

These vents must have a net opening area of not less than 0.5m\u00b2. This requirement ensures adequate cross-ventilation in deep terrace houses where interior spaces might otherwise be far from natural light and air sources.

    "answer": "Yes, when the rear side of your plot is adjacent to a reservation of a river, canal, wetland, forest, or similar natural feature prescribed in development plans or by relevant authorities, such reservation may be considered for calculating the rear space requirement. This means you may not need to provide additional rear space within your property boundary if the river reservation already provides sufficient buffer. However, you must still comply with all other regulatory requirements regarding plot coverage, height limitations, and side setbacks."

    "answer": "For your 200-seat theater, calculate sanitary facilities per Schedule 13: For females: 1) Toilets: 1 per 40 seats = 200 \u00f7 40 = 5 toilets, 2) Washbasins: 1 per 50 seats = 200 \u00f7 50 = 4 washbasins. For males: 1) Toilets: 1 per 120 seats = 200 \u00f7 120 = 1.67 rounded to 2 toilets, 2) Urinals: 1 per 40 seats = 200 \u00f7 40 = 5 urinals, 3) Washbasins: 1 per 120 seats = 200 \u00f7 120 = 1.67 rounded to 2 washbasins. Total required: 7 toilets, 5 urinals, and 6 washbasins. Additionally, you must provide accessible facilities complying with the Protection of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, properly ventilated toilet areas, and all fixtures connected to appropriate drainage systems."
