    "question": "I own a 1200m\u00b2 property at the intersection of three roads: a 15m-wide main road (20m frontage), a 9m-wide side road (15m frontage), and a 4m-wide back lane (12m frontage). My property is in a zone with factor 2.0. How do I accurately calculate my maximum permissible floor area?",
    "answer": "To calculate your permissible floor area: 1) Identify your land extent (1200m\u00b2), 2) For road frontage calculation with multiple roads: a) Main road (15m wide): Use full frontage of 20m, b) Side road (9m wide): Since this is \u22656m, calculate proportionate frontage as 20m \u00d7 (9m \u00f7 15m) = 12m, c) Back lane (4m wide): Since this is <6m, use the full width of the road itself (4m), d) Total calculated frontage: 20m + 12m + 4m = 36m, 3) Look up Form A in Schedule 6 for zone factor 2.0, land extent 1000-1500m\u00b2, and access from 15m or wider road: Permissible Floor Area Ratio is 8.0, 4) Calculate: 1200m\u00b2 \u00d7 8.0 = 9,600m\u00b2 maximum permissible floor area, excluding parking facilities, air-conditioning plants, and other service machinery. Your building design must still comply with plot coverage limits and setback requirements."

    "question": "My narrow rectangular lot is 6m wide by 50m deep. The front faces a 9m-wide road, and the rear borders a public park with a 15m reservation. How should I calculate my required rear setback, and can I use the park reservation in this calculation?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can use the park reservation in your rear setback calculation. According to Regulation 56(3), when the rear side of a plot is adjacent to a reservation of a park, river, canal, wetland, forest, or similar natural feature prescribed in development plans or by relevant authorities, such reservation may be considered for calculating the rear space requirement. This means you effectively have a substantial rear buffer due to the 15m park reservation. However, you must still comply with all other regulatory requirements regarding plot coverage, side setbacks (which are determined by your building height according to Form E in Schedule 6), and other applicable provisions. Since your lot has a limited 6m width, ensure that side setbacks don't excessively constrain your buildable area, as the side setback requirements increase with building height."

    "question": "I'm developing a property on a hillside with a 15-degree slope. What specific regulations apply to my site regarding plot coverage, excavation, and retaining walls?",
    "answer": "For your hillside property with 15-degree slope: 1) Show existing contours or spot levels on your site plan (required for slopes >10 degrees), 2) Submit a geotechnical investigation report (required for slopes >10 degrees), 3) Indicate any new slopes or embankments with retaining walls on your plans, 4) Since your slope is between 10-20 degrees, your building doesn't automatically fall into Category B, but the Authority may require additional safety measures, 5) For plot coverage: the standard requirements apply, but the Authority may restrict the Permissible Floor Area Ratio based on slope conditions, 6) For excavations: maintain minimum 1.0m from boundaries (may be increased based on geotechnical recommendations), 7) For retaining walls: include detailed structural designs certified by a qualified engineer, 8) The distance between any existing/required retaining wall exceeding 1.5m in height to the proposed building, lot boundaries, and any existing building within 10.0m must be shown on section drawings. Obtain NBRO clearance before commencing construction."

    "question": "I have a property in a zone with factor 3.5. It's 2000m\u00b2 with a 12m-wide access road and 25m frontage. How many floors can I build if I want to maintain 60% plot coverage?",
    "answer": "For your property: 1) Zone factor 3.5, land extent 2000m\u00b2, 12m-wide access road: According to Form A in Schedule 6, your Permissible Floor Area Ratio is 8.0, 2) Calculate total permissible floor area: 2000m\u00b2 \u00d7 8.0 = 16,000m\u00b2, 3) With 60% plot coverage, your building footprint is: 2000m\u00b2 \u00d7 0.6 = 1,200m\u00b2 per floor, 4) Calculate maximum number of floors: 16,000m\u00b2 \u00f7 1,200m\u00b2 = 13.33 floors, 5) Therefore, you can build up to 13 full floors. However, you must also comply with: a) Setback requirements which increase with building height per Form E in Schedule 6, b) Minimum parking requirements based on building use, c) Other requirements for buildings exceeding 15m in height (fire safety, lifts, etc.), d) Any height restrictions in the specific Development Plan for your area. Note that as your building gets taller, upper floors may need to be smaller to accommodate increased setback requirements, potentially allowing more than 13 floors with progressive setbacks."

    "answer": "For your mixed-use building: 1) Calculate Permissible Floor Area: a) Zone factor 1.75, land extent 750-1000m\u00b2, 12m-wide access road: Form A in Schedule 6 gives a Floor Area Ratio of 5.1, b) Maximum floor area: 800m\u00b2 \u00d7 5.1 = 4,080m\u00b2, 2) For open spaces, according to Form E in Schedule 6 for a building with 6 floors (approximately 18-24m height): a) Rear space: minimum 4.0m, b) Side spaces: minimum 3.0m on both sides, 3) Your building must comply with both residential and commercial requirements: a) Commercial ground floor: follows non-residential requirements for parking (1 space per 100m\u00b2), sanitation facilities, and floor heights (minimum 3.0m), b) Residential upper floors: follows residential requirements for unit sizes, light and ventilation, and parking (2 spaces per unit >150m\u00b2). Remember that 50% of open space must be unpaved/green area, and you need to show all parking arrangements on your site plan. With your 15m frontage, adequate space should be available for entrances to both commercial and residential portions."

    "question": "I own a 400m\u00b2 corner lot at the intersection of a 9m road and a 6m road in a Medium Density Zone. How should I calculate both the corner splay and the permissible floor area?",
    "answer": "For your corner lot: 1) Corner splay calculation: You must round or splay the corner by maintaining half the width of each road, which means: a) 4.5m (half of 9m) along the first road, and b) 3m (half of 6m) along the second road, from the corner point, 2) Permissible Floor Area calculation: a) Land extent: 400m\u00b2, b) Medium Density Zone with 400m\u00b2 plot in the 375-500m\u00b2 category, c) For 9m road access: Using Form C in Schedule 6, your Floor Area Ratio is 1.6, d) Maximum floor area: 400m\u00b2 \u00d7 1.6 = 640m\u00b2. 3) Note that the area lost to the corner splay is still counted in your total land area for floor area calculations, but reduces your actual buildable area. You must still comply with setback requirements based on building height (Form E in Schedule 6) and ensure that the corner remains splayed or rounded to a height of at least 6.0m above street level to maintain traffic visibility."

    "question": "I'm planning a renovation that includes a 2.5m cantilevered balcony on the second floor of my building, which is 2.0m from the side boundary. Is this permitted under the regulations, and what specific conditions apply?",
    "answer": "Your proposed 2.5m cantilevered balcony would not be permitted as designed because: 1) According to Regulation 60(1), overhangs, canopies, wings or sun-shading devices may only extend to a maximum of 1.2m beyond the Building Line or toward the rear space, 2) Since your balcony exceeds 1.2m (at 2.5m), the excess portion (1.3m) would be included in your Permissible Floor Area calculation per Regulation 46(5), 3) According to Regulation 60(2), when a balcony faces an adjacent property, a minimum of 1.0m distance must be maintained from the outer edge of the balcony to the relevant boundary, 4) Since your building is 2.0m from the boundary, a balcony extending 2.5m would only leave -0.5m to the boundary, violating the 1.0m minimum requirement. You would need to redesign the balcony to extend no more than 1.0m from the building face to maintain the required 1.0m from the boundary, or alternatively, construct a 2m high Guard Wall at the boundary if building the balcony up to the boundary."

    "question": "I have a 1500m\u00b2 property with a 15m-wide access road. I want to build the maximum possible floor area with a stepped design (smaller upper floors). How should I calculate setbacks at different heights to maximize my buildable area?",
    "answer": "To maximize buildable area with a stepped design: 1) Determine your Permissible Floor Area Ratio from Schedule 6 based on your zone factor, 2) For setbacks, use Form E in Schedule 6, which provides a sliding scale: a) For height 0-7.5m (approx. 1-2 floors): Rear space 2.3m, Side spaces 1.0m, b) For height 7.5-12.0m (approx. 3-4 floors): Rear space 3.0m, Side spaces 2.0m, c) For height 12.0-18.0m (approx. 4-6 floors): Rear space 4.0m, Side spaces 3.0m, d) For height 18.0-24.0m (approx. 6-8 floors): Rear space 5.0m, Side spaces 4.0m, e) For height 24.0-30.0m (approx. 8-10 floors): Rear space 6.0m, Side spaces 5.0m, f) For heights above 30.0m: Rear space 7.0m, Side spaces 6.0m. 3) Design your building with a base that uses the minimum setbacks, then step back upper floors to accommodate increased setback requirements. This creates a terraced effect where each height threshold requires more setback. Calculate the maximum buildable area at each level and ensure the total doesn't exceed your permissible floor area."
