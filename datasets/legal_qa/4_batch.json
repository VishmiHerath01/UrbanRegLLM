    "question": "What are the requirements for the distance between windows and opposite boundaries for natural light and ventilation?",
    "answer": "The distance between means for natural light and ventilation in a Room and the opposite boundary of the open space must be maintained as specified in Form E of Schedule 6. For water-closets, toilets, or bathrooms, the minimum distance shall not be less than 1.0m. This ensures adequate light, air, and privacy for all habitable spaces while allowing more compact arrangements for utility spaces."

    "answer": "No site or lot abutting a street less than nine meters (9m) in width shall be used for non-residential use or construction of any building for such use. However, a street meant to serve one or more lots for non-residential use may be permitted with access less than 9m in width subject to conformity with specifications in Form A in Schedule 4. This ensures commercial activities have adequate access while allowing flexibility for smaller-scale enterprises."

    "question": "How do floor area calculations differ when a building has access from multiple roads of different widths?",
    "answer": "When a building has access from multiple roads of different widths, the floor area calculation considers the Permissible Floor Area from the widest road. Additionally, road frontage can be enhanced by: 1) For multiple independent roads \u22656m wide: adding portions of frontage from other roads proportionate to width ratios, 2) For multiple roads <6m wide: adding the full widths of other roads, 3) For by-roads: adding the widths of such by-roads. This approach rewards sites with multiple access points while prioritizing the primary access."

    "question": "How does the development of an underserved settlement affect road width requirements?",
    "answer": "Where the Authority determines that undue hardship may be caused due to minimum road width requirements, the width may be reduced if: 1) A minimum width of 3.0m is available in the access road, or 2) The proposal is to improve the status of an underserved settlement. The street must connect to a public or private road of at least 6.0m width where the owner has right of way. This reduction does not apply to new land subdivisions. This provision allows for practical upgrading of existing informal settlements."

    "question": "What are the particular zoning considerations for lands adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas?",
    "answer": "When the rear side of a plot is adjacent to a reservation of a river, canal, wetland, forest, or similar natural feature prescribed in development plans or by relevant authorities, such reservation may be considered for calculating the rear space requirement. Additionally, in subdivisions where the land is located adjacent to environmentally sensitive features, the community/recreation reserved space should preferably be located adjacent to these features. This approach creates buffer zones and enhances ecological connectivity."

For buildings at junctions where the degree of splay is not specified in development plans, the corner shall be splayed or rounded to a height of at least 6.0m above street level. This ensures visibility at intersections for traffic safety while establishing a consistent architectural treatment of corner buildings."

    "question": "How does the authority determine the maximum permitted building height in relation to land area and access?",
    "answer": "Maximum building height is restricted to 10.0m when: 1) The land area is less than 150m\u00b2, 2) The access road is less than 3.0m wide, or 3) The road frontage is less than 6.0m. For other situations, height limits are determined by the permissible floor area ratio, which increases with larger land parcels and wider access roads. Zone factors also influence permitted height, with higher zone factors allowing taller buildings. This graduated approach ensures building height is proportionate to plot size and infrastructure capacity."
