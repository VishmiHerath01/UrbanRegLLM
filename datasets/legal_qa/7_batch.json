    "question": "I'm developing a 2,500m\u00b2 commercial building in an area with 1800mm annual rainfall. How do I calculate the exact rainwater storage capacity required, and how should I distribute this between storage and infiltration?",
    "answer": "For your 2,500m\u00b2 commercial building in 1800mm rainfall area: 1) Identify your rainfall band from Schedule 14: 1500-2000mm, 2) For commercial buildings in this band, the requirement is 3m\u00b3 per 100m\u00b2 of roof and paved area, 3) Assuming 1,800m\u00b2 roof area and 500m\u00b2 paved area: Total catchment = 2,300m\u00b2, 4) Required capacity: (2,300m\u00b2 \u00f7 100m\u00b2) \u00d7 3m\u00b3 = 69m\u00b3, 5) Distribution between storage and infiltration is determined by the local authority based on: a) Groundwater table fluctuation, b) Available space, c) Topography, d) Soil permeability. Typically, at least 50% should be storage with the remainder as infiltration. Your storage options include: above ground (tanks), on ground (ponds), or below ground (cisterns). Infiltration can include: unpaved ground (100m\u00b2 counts as 0.5m\u00b3), wastewater pits, unlined ponds, dug wells, or boreholes. All systems must be designed by qualified persons, discharge first flush rain, and use pipes/appurtenances differentiated by color and markings."
